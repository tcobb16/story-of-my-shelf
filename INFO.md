1. Create an app where a user can create an account where they can search for books. Each person’s account will have a “To Be Read” list, “Finished Reading” list, and “Favorites” list that they can add books to. There will also be a section to request reading suggestions by searching by author or genre. 

2. The demographic can vary across age and interests, it’s meant for anyone that enjoys reading and wants to track their books. 

3. I plan on using the Google Books APIs: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#PerformingSearch 

4. A. The database will include a book’s title, author, and genre. I think it could also be good to try to include a series name if there is one and which book number each respective book is in that series (book 1, book 2, etc.) I am unsure if the API has this specific info without having searched for a series yet.

B. I may not be able to find series names or numbers, I’m also not sure if there are image links for each book, but would like to pull covers in when a person searches.

C. Information that would need to be secured would include the user's password, username, and email for logging in. 

D. Users will be able to favorite and unfavorite books, add or remove books to lists. They can also discover books by searching via genre or author.

E. The login screen will have a place for the username and password, after logging in they will land on the home page which will have the search bar for looking up books, there will be a link to go to their profile where they can view their individual book lists, and a logout button that returns them to the login screen,.

F. Having the functionality to add and remove items to specific lists. A stretch goal would be advancing the app into something where people can follow each other and leave/read reviews of books (similar to Goodreads)
