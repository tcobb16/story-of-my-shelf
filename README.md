Story of my Shelf user flow: user lands on the homepage where they are able to either log in with an existing account or create a new account. After getting signed in they land on the user homepage. On this page they can see their user name, profile pictures, and links to three lists: favorites, read, and to be read. Clicking on the user name will take them to a profile edit section, while clicking on any of the lists will take them to the books that are in that list. 

Also on the home page is the search bar where a user can search by title, author, or genre. With each search result there are three buttons, 1 each for adding a book to the favorite list, read list, or to be read list. After adding a book to a list the user is redirected to that list.
